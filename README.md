# Image-processing-using-Open-MP
A short simple program that uses Open-MP library to parallelise an image processing algorithm
Open-MP is a library used to implement parallel programs on shared memory systems in contrast to Open-MPI that is used on distributed memory systems
I have implemented the same program using Open-MPI which you can find [here](https://github.com/MumbiGachomba04/Image-processing-using-open-MPI).
